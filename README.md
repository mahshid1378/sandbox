# sandbox
Development sandbox for front end projects and tutorials.
This is where I place all my mini-projects and exercises that only require a front end. Todo App - Based on Watch and Code by Gordie Zhu. DOM Manipulation - Playing around with DOM manipulation and vanilla JS. Color Changer - Making a little color theme picker. Dave - I don't remember why this is here, but it seems important. Portfolio - Web developer resume/portfolio example. Ghibli - Studio Ghibli web app for learning how to connect to an API. Tab - New Tab app for learning how to use local storage.
